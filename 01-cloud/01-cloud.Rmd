## Activity 

.hand[while we wait to get started...]

- Go to [bit.ly/teach-r-online-cloud](https://bit.ly/teach-r-online-cloud)
- Log in with Google or GitHub, or create a new account
- Once you join our workspace, start the assignment titled `COVID-19`
- Knit the document titled `covid-19.Rmd` and inspect the visualisation
- Then, in the R Markdown document, change one of the countries plotted to a country of your own choice
- Knit again, and inspect

## What is RStudio Cloud?

<br>

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
.large[We created [**RStudio Cloud**](https://rstudio.cloud/) to make it easy for professionals, hobbyists, trainers, teachers, and students to do, share, teach, and learn data science using R.]
]

---

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-ide.png")
```
]

---

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud.png")
```
]

---

## Why RStudio Cloud?

- Does not require IT support

--
- Git works out of the box
- Knit to PDF and Word works out of the box

--
- Features designed for instructors

---

## Contexts

- Shorter workshops: Likely no opportunity to communicate pre-workshop instructions, varied computing background and learning goals

- Semester long courses
  - Intro data science / statistics: little to no background in stats, data science, programming
  - Upper level data science / statistics: Varied computing background and different computer setups

---

## RStudio Cloud: First look

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/landing-1.png")
```

---

## Workspaces

- When you create an account on RStudio Cloud you get a workspace of your own

- You can add a new workspace and control its permissions

- Projects in either workspace can be public or private

---

## A framework for workspaces

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/landing-2.png")
```

---

## Projects

.pull-left[
A new project in RStudio Cloud
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
is a new project in RStudio IDE
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-local.png")
```
]

.alert[
**PSA:** If you use RStudio, use projects! Trust me, you won’t regret it. Find out more on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
]

---

## Projects from Git

.pull-left[
A new project from Git repo in RStudio Cloud
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-git-cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
is the same as a new project from Git in RStudio IDE
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-git-local.png")
```
]

Both options `clone` a Git repo

---

## Sharing options

- Option 1: Share a single project

- Option 2: Invite users to a workspace (presumably with many projects)

`r emo::ji("woman_teacher")`: Identify one person in the group as **instructor** (Tip: Choose someone *without* a second / large display)  
`r emo::ji("woman_technologist")`: Rest of the group are **students**

#### `r emo::ji("woman_teacher")` Instructor:
- Create a new project and give it a name
- Install a package of your choice
- Create a template R Markdown document in the project
- Change the access level of the project so others can see it as well
- Copy the project URL and share it with the rest of the group in the chat box

#### `r emo::ji("woman_technologist")` Students: 
Access your instructor's project and pick up where they left off

```{r echo=FALSE}

## Pros / cons: Sharing a single project

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Students land directly in a project upon login
- Works well for workshops where all work will be completed in a single project
- Also great for sharing code in general, e.g. collaboration, reprexes, etc.
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students need to remember to make a copy of the project (which means you need to remember to remind them!)
- You can't keep track which students started their assignment
- Students control permissions
- You can't easily peek into student projects -- they would need to explicitly share the project with you

## Base projects

One of the most attractive features of RStudio Cloud!

- Packages you want *installed* on all student projects

--
- Text documents you want to appear on **all** student projects (e.g. code of conduct, turn-in instructions, etc.)

--
- Applies to all projects created **after** base project has been specified, doesn't apply retroactively

--
- Can be updated as many times as you like throughout the course (without having to convince your IT!!!)

]

---

.your-turn[

#### `r emo::ji("woman_teacher")` Instructor:

- Create a new workspace, give it a name, and add a short description
- Change the settings of your workspace to Shared
- Change the permissions of your workspace how you like
- Add a base project to your workspace:
  - Create a new project
  - Install one or two of your favourite packages
  - Start an R Markdown document so necessary packages get installed
  - Add a code-of-conduct.md or some other plain text document
  - Make this project visible to everyone
  - In the settings menu for the workspace, set it as base project
- Create a new assignment: `Homework 01`.
- Grab the sharing link for your workspace and share with your group.

#### `r emo::ji("woman_technologist")` Students:
- Join your instructor's workspace and start the assignment.

## Git integration

`r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Only relevant if teaching with Git & GitHub!

--

`r emo::ji("grin")` Base project template can be used, so new project from Git also has the right packages installed!

*More on this in Workshop 3 on 17 July!*

---

## Pros / cons: Sharing a workspace

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Various permission levels
- Base projects with desired packages installed
- Assignments -- no more "make a copy of the project before starting work"
- Peek into students’ projects
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/view-derived-projects.png")
```
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students land in the workspace, may need to provide instructions for the next steps
- Git config for each project can get tedious and doesn't reflect realistic practice
]

---

## Common pitfalls

- Changes you make after student launches a project under either model (single project or workspace) won’t propagate to their project


--
- Packages in the base project will be **installed** in all projects in the workspace, but not **loaded**
  - If you need students to run code in the Console that requires a package, your instructions should remind them to load the package first
  - If using Rmd document, add a `load-package` chunk on top

# Parting remarks

---

## Tips

- Each project is allocated 1GB of RAM
  - Test things out before assignments involving large datasets 

- What your students see is not always what you see
  - Create a secondary account and add as a student

---

## More tips

Make brief screencasts for getting students oriented with the platform (especially if remote teaching), or use mine!

---

## `r emo::ji("parcel")` rscloud

- You can access RStudio Cloud's API to manage space members programatically using the **rscloud** package:

- You will need to create client credentials to use the package. You can create credentials at [login.rstudio.cloud/identity](https://login.rstudio.cloud/identity).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("rscloud")
