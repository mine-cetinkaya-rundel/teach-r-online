**This is a demo tutorial created for the "Building interactive tutorials in R" workshop. See [here](http://bit.ly/teach-r-online-mats) for slides and full set of materials from the workshop series.**

## Introduction

```{r stormtrooper, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Illustration by Allison Horst."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lter_penguins.png")
```

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). 

The data are distributed in the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package. 


### Learning goals

- Practice developing exercises with learnr.
- Practice writing code checking tests with gradethis.

### Getting help

If you have any questions call for help in Zoom!

### Packages

In this assignment we will work with the **palmerpenguins** and **tidyverse** packages. So let's go ahead and load them!

```{r load-package, exercise = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Multiple choice questions

Modify the following question to:

- Allow retry for incorrect answers
- Display answers in a random order
- Customise the message text for correct answer
- Customise the message texts for incorrect answers (try giving different pieces of feedback for different incorrect answers)
- Modify the penguin color question to allow multiple correct answers
- Place the two questions in a `quiz()`

```{r awesome-penguins}
question(
  "How awesome are penguins?",
  answer("Super awesome!", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Awesome"),
  answer("Meh"),
  answer("Not awesome"),
  answer("Super not awesome")
)
```

```{r penguin-colors}
question(
  "Penguins are which of the following colors?",
  answer("Black", correct = TRUE),
  answer("White"),
  answer("Magenta"),
  answer("Cyan")
)
```

## Code exercises

Create a frequency table of the species of penguins on Biscoe island, and display the results in descending order of frequency.

Your task is to add more `fail_if()` statements to the code checking chunk to check for realistic mistakes students can make and give them informative feedback that will nudge them in the right direction.

```{r penguins-count, exercise = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  filter(island __ "Biscoe") %>%
  ___(___)
```

```{r penguins-count-hint-1}
penguins %>%
  filter(island == "Biscoe") %>%
  count(___, ___)
```

```{r penguins-count-hint-2}
Add a hint...
```

```{r penguins-count-solution}
penguins %>%
  filter(island == "Biscoe") %>%
  count(species, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r penguins-count-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(as.numeric(.result[1,2]), 124), "In this dataset, the most common species of penguins on Biscoe island are Gentoo pengiuns."),
  fail_if(~ identical(as.numeric(.result[1,2]), 123), "Checking for 123 doesn't make sense here, change this to some other realistic check."),
  # add more fail_if() statements...
  fail_if(~ TRUE, "Not quite! ___")
)
```
