.hand[while we wait to get started...]

- Go to [INSERT LINK](INSERT LINK)
- Start working through the tutorial
- Feel free to make mistakes and test out the feedback
- If you get to the very end, follow the instructions (but if they seem a bit opaque, don't fret, we'll say more about "submission" later...)

Suppose 10 means from a simulated sampling distribution is stored in a vector called `means`.

```r
means
```

```
##  [1] -1.21  0.28  1.08 -2.35  0.43  0.51 -0.57 -0.55 -0.56 -0.89

## Nudging

.hand[Not all feedback is useful, at least not for beginners...]

&lt;br&gt;

Providing helpful feedback can help them nudge them towards success:


```r
mean[1]
```


```
## x `mean` is a function and a function doesn't have elements that can be subsetted with square brackets.
```

```
## ℹ `means` is the vector of sample means calculated earlier.
```

.sample-question[
Visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage of cars from the `mpg` dataset, conditional on year of manufacture.
]

--
&lt;br&gt;
.sample-answer[
There is a strong, positive, linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of cars. Year does not seem to be related to either variable.

```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x = hwy, y = cty, fill=year)) +geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```

&lt;img src="02-tutorial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="70%" /&gt;
]

---

class: middle

.pull-left-wide[
.sample-feedback[
- You mention a linear relationship, however your plot uses a loess fit to visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage. Also, the plot displays the uncertainty around the fit, but you haven't addressed it in your narrative.
- Year should be mapped to the `color` aesthetic, not `fill`. 
- Plot styling: Use informative axis labels, noting units of measurement. Also, give an informative title to your plot.
- Code styling: Use consistent spacing around operators (e.g ` = `) and line breaks after `+` in each layer of your ggplot.

## Scaling

.hand[Our courses are growing, and that's a good thing, right?]

--

- Students turning in their work as R Markdown documents makes collecting submissions including code and narrative straightforward.

--

- Providing feedback on both the code and narrative is not scalable unless (human) resources dedicated to your course grow proportionally with enrolments.

## 📦 learnr

- **learnr** is an R package that makes it easy to create interactive tutorials from R Markdown documents.

- Tutorials can include:
  - Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations
  - Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly)
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Videos (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - Interactive Shiny components

- learnr is on CRAN


```r
install.packages("learnr")
```

## 📦 gradethis

- Companion to the learnr package, **gradethis** provides multiple methods to grade learnr exercises:
  - `grade_code()`: Grade code against a solution
  - `grade_conditions()`: Grade all specified conditions
  - `grade_result()`: Grade result of exercise code

- gradethis is not yet on CRAN


```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/gradethis")
```

## YAML

Start with a YAML, just like in R Markdown:


```r
---
title: "Lego Sales"
output: 
  learnr::tutorial:
    progressive: true
    allow_skip: true
    css: "css/font-size.css"
runtime: shiny_prerendered
---
```

- `runtime: shiny_prerendered`
- `progressive: true` for continue buttons between subsections
- `alow_skip: true` to allow skipping exercises

---

## Customization

- You can change the style of your learnr tutorial
- You might, at a minimum, implement a couple customizations for accessibility:
  - Increase font size in the narrative, using a CSS file that lives in a directory called `css` and loaded in the YAML with


```r
css: "css/font-size.css"
```

  - Increase font size in code boxes, using a JS file that lives in a directory called `js` and loaded with 
  

```r
&lt;script language="JavaScript" src="js/exercise-font-size.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```
  
---

## Narrative

- R Markdown style section and subsection headings with `##`, `###`, etc.
- Text, figures, illustrations, and equations.
- Videos: supported services include YouTube and Vimeo

---

## Multiple choice questions


```r
quiz(
  question("What number is the letter A in the alphabet?",
    answer("8"),
    answer("14"),
    answer("1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("23"),
    incorrect = "See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet) and try again.",
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

  question("Where are you right now? (select ALL that apply)",
    answer("Planet Earth", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Pluto"),
    answer("At a computing device", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In the Milky Way", correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = paste0("Incorrect. You're on Earth, ",
                       "in the Milky Way, at a computer.")
  )
)
```

---

## Text entry questions


```r
question_text(
  "Please enter the word 'C0rrect' below:",
  answer("correct", message = "Don't forget to capitalize"),
  answer("c0rrect", message = "Don't forget to capitalize"),
  answer("Correct", message = "Is it really an 'o'?"),
  answer("C0rrect ", message = "Make sure you do not have a trailing space"),
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  trim = FALSE
)
```

## Sharing with students

- You could share the R Markdown document (and all accompanying files) but that’s probably not what you want to do...

- Deploy on
  - shinyapps.io
  - RStudio Connect (free for academic use, requires setup)

- Road less travelled: distribute as a package

.huge-text[recording]
.huge-text[data]

---

.large[
.hand[Q: Is it possible to record student data?]
]

Yes, though not trivial, at this point. 

---

## Recording attempts

- A "good enough" solution for formative exercises: embed a 
Google/Microsoft/etc. Form at the end and ask students to "submit" their work.

- This only records that the student reached the end of the tutorial and not how (or even if) they answered any of the questions or exercises.

- **Tip:** Add a free-text question to the form asking students to reflect on the exercises they just completed - you can then analyse the free-text data to gain insights into what students are struggling with -- "minute paper".

[**`[example]`**](https://minecr.shinyapps.io/04-wrangleviz/#section-finish-up)

---

## Recording solutions

- The [`learnrhash`](https://github.com/rundel/learnrhash) package builds on the previous method by providing a way for students to submit their answers by generating a text "hash" which can be copy and pasted into the web form.


```r
devtools::install_github("rundel/learnrhash")
```

- This package is being used to create the submission tool at the end of the sample tutorial.


.footnote[
See also the [**submitr**](https://github.com/dtkaplan/submitr) package by Danny Kaplan for a different approach to recording event data in learnr tutorials.

## Submissions

Since I've just submitted, my details and my hash will now be stored in a Google Sheet - if you would like to play around with this data (Instructor mode) you can access it here:

We don't have time today to demo reading in and decoding these data, but we will include code for the whole process in the [learnrhash package repository](https://github.com/rundel/learnrhash) in the next week, using data from your submissions.

## Best practices for automated feedback

--

- Measure twice, cut once (verify the correctness of your tests) 📏📏 ✂️

--

- Use rounding &amp; type coercion to write robust tests 💪

--

- Don't give automated feedback on everything, asking narrative questions that can't be auto checked but gets the student thinking and writing has pedagogical benefits 🙈

--

- Consider peer feedback where automated feedback is not feasible (e.g. interpretation, narrative) but scalability is an issue 👯

---

.large[
.hand[Q: What is an approachable way to get started?]
]

Build a tutorial where students build develop their analysis in exercise code 
chunks (that are not checked) and only multiple choice questions are used for 
assessment. [**`[example]`**](https://minecr.shinyapps.io/04-wrangleviz)

&lt;img src="images/learnr-simple.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.large[
.hand[Q: I've built simple tutorials already. How do I make the jump to code checking and providing automated feedback that is actually useful?]
]

- Replicate `gradethis::gradethis_demo()`, then make incremental changes
- Read the [Testing](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html#test-tests) chapter in R Packages (Wickham and Bryan) 
- Also read the [Metaprogramming](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/metaprogramming.html) section in Advanced R (Wickham)

&lt;img src="images/learnr-learn-more.jpeg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.large[
.hand[Q: Sounds great, but can it handle my class size and usage?]
]

- First, chances are you're not using these live, but you might be...
- If so, make sure to max out your instances and instance size on shinyapps.io.
- Essential reading:
